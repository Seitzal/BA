Barometer elections are defined as elections that reflect changes in citizens' attitudes toward the government in response to changing political and economic conditions, absent the opportunity to install a new executive. We classify British by-elections and German Land elections as barometer elections and test a general model that incorporates the electoral cycle; public opinion toward the government; economic conditions; and previous performance as determinants of election outcomes. Considering both short-term and long-term changes in public attitudes and economic performance in the empirical analysis, we find that barometer election outcomes can be explained with a similar set of independent variables across systems.},

  abstract = {Since the installment of direct elections to the European Parliament, turnout has been falling. The implications of low, and ever falling, turnout are many. By holding second-order elections in the form of local elections on the same day as the election for the European Parliament, which also is a second-order election, turnout increases. This thesis estimates that turnout would increase by approximately 8-9\% when elections are held concurrently. This is tested using panel data for all member states of the European Union in the elections of 2004-2014. Also, the underlying factors for this effect on turnout are examined in all concurring national- and EP elections between 1979-2014. The two competing factors are the cost of voting and the salience of the election. Of the two it is the cost of voting that mostly explains the positive effect of the concurrent elections. By testing the concurrent second-order elections over time and across countries it provides a more robust understanding of the phenomena, adding to the previous research. Moreover, it displays a low-cost tool for policymakers to boost turnout in less important elections by holding them together with either other less important elections (second-order) or with more important elections (first-order).},

It begins by examining the concepts of democracy and legitimacy as applied to the supranational level of governance, by briefly reviewing approaches to the study of turnout, including the approach embodied in the second-order-election model, and by describing the main features of the survey (Eurobarometer 41.1, (1994)) on which the study is based. The book summarizes the trends in turnout in European Parliament elections and makes a key distinction between circumstantial and voluntary abstention. This is followed by a series of chapters dealing with attitudes to European integration, the European Parliament, and European elections, each chapter concluding with a bivariate analysis of the relationship between such attitudes and participation/abstention in European Parliament elections. The trends in attitudes and in turnout are also considered on a country-by-country basis. -- From http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198293089.001.0001/acprof-9780198293088 (Oct. 23, 2012).},

An interesting proposal that has been put forward to address this problem is to elect some members of the European parliament in a pan-European district. In this article, we evaluate this proposal using an online experiment, in which thousands of Europeans voted on a pan-European ballot we created. We find that the voting behaviour of European citizens would be strongly affected by the presence or absence of candidates from their own country on the lists. If a pan-European district is created, our findings provide an argument in favour of using a closed-list ballot and establishing a maximum number of candidates from each country on the lists.},

We study change patterns in electoral behavior and, more importantly, assess the motives behind differences in vote choices between first- and second-order elections.

  abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed germination; longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

The fact that turnout among the economically disadvantaged is especially low in municipal elections means that citizens most in need of services provided at the local level may not be represented in policy decisions that affect their daily lives. This paper reports the results of an experiment that compares the effects of two voter mobilization interventions: traditional canvassing appeals and face-to-face exchanges in which canvassers distribute a feedback intervention consisting of printed records of individual voter histories. In contrast to previous studies, this experiment measures the effectiveness of using social pressure to mobilize turnout among relatively infrequent voters in a low salience election. The campaign was implemented by a credible tenant advocacy organization within the context of a municipal election; the sample consisted of registered voters in two Boston public housing developments. I find that the feedback intervention dramatically increased voter turnout. Turnout among those reached by canvassers with voter histories was approximately 15–18 percentage points higher than turnout in the control group, an effect that is approximately 10 percentage points larger in magnitude than that of standard face-to-face mobilization.},

Auch international waren Wahlbeteiligung und Wahlenthaltung alles andere als zentrale Probleme der Wahlsoziologie2. Der Gang zur Wahlurne wurde — zumindest bei Bundestagswahlen — stillschweigend als das Normale, moralisch oder staatspolitisch Gebotene und damit nicht weiter zu Begründende angesehen. Lediglich bei der Erklärung von Wahlresultatsschwankungen und in den — allerdings eher am Rande der empirischen Wahlforschung angesiedelten — formalen Kalkülen der Rational-Choice-Theoretiker spielte die Kategorie des Nichtwählens eine gewisse Rolle3.},

The addition of 10 new members for the 2004 election results presents a unique opportunity to test established explanations of turnout in EP elections. The authors re-examine models developed from general participation studies and applied in earlier research on turnout in EP elections. The updated and revised analysis continues to point to the importance of both national and European Union—level influences in explaining EP election turnout. Thus, although the second-order model of European elections still holds considerable appeal, the increasing divergence of turnout patterns in 2004 and through time suggests that European issues may be important in some countries.},

  abstract = {The June 1999 elections to the European Parliament were the fourth to show lower turnout, suggesting to some a decline in support for the European project. This paper shows, however, that turnout decline has been built into the EC/EU enlargement process. In the first EP elections, voting was compulsory in 40\% of participating countries; but no more compulsory voting countries have joined the EC/EU, so the effects of this variable have become increasingly diluted. An even more important factor has been the boost to turnout that new member countries generally enjoy at their first EP election. The loss of this boost in subsequent elections joins with the declining proportion of compulsory voting countries to explain virtually all the decline in turnout at EP elections since 1979. This finding emphasizes the importance of keeping track of the changing composition of the entity being studied when trying to understand electoral change.},

One possible answer is that because little is at stake in these second-order elections only those with an established habit of voting, acquired in previous national elections, can be counted on to vote. Others argue that low turnout is an indication of apathy or even scepticism towards Europe. This article conducts a critical test of the “little at stake” hypothesis by focusing on a testable implication: that turnout at these elections will be particularly low on the part of voters not yet socialized into habitual voting. This proposition is examined using both time-series cross-section analyses and a regression discontinuity design. Our findings show that EP elections depress turnout as they inculcate habits of non-voting, with long-term implications for political participation in EU member states.},

Gegenstand der vorliegenden Studie sind folglich die beständigen Niveauunterschiede in den Beteiligungsraten bei nationalen Wahlen zwischen achtzehn Demokratien seit 1960. Es wird gefragt, wie gross das Ausmass der Niveauunterschiede hinsichtlich der Partizipation bei nationalen Wahlen zwischen den Ländern ist und welche Bestimmungsgründe dies hat. Acht hauptsächliche Bestimmungsgründe der Niveauunterschiede in der Wahlbeteiligung im Nationenvergleich kristallisieren sich heraus. Es sind dies in erster Linie die Wahlpflicht, der Umfang von Regierungen oder Regierungskoalitionen zum Zeitpunkt vor der Wahl, die Häufigkeit und das Ausmass von Regierungswechseln oder -änderungen, das Alter des allgemeinen Frauenwahlrechtes, die Stärke parteiförmiger Organisation von politischen und sozialen Konflikten, der Organisationsgrad der Gewerkschaften, das Ausmass an Staatstätigkeit sowie die Partizipationstradition. Diese Variablen werden zu einem Modell gebündelt, dass die Niveauunterschiede zum grossen Teil zu erklären vermag.},

This article provides the first direct test of the hypothesis that casting a ballot in one election increases one's propensity to go to the polls in the future. A field experiment involving 25,200 registered voters was conducted prior to the November general election of 1998. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment conditions in which they were urged to vote through direct mail or face-to-face canvassing. Compared to a control group that received no contact, the treatment groups were significantly more likely to vote in 1998. The treatment groups were also significantly more likely to vote in local elections held in November of 1999. After deriving a statistical estimator to isolate the effect of habit, we find that, ceteris paribus, voting in one election substantially increases the likelihood of voting in the future. Indeed, the influence of past voting exceeds the effects of age and education reported in previous studies.},

We answer this question by looking at all European elections                     (1979–2004) in all 25 EU states. We find that almost 40\% of the volatility in                     party vote-shares in European elections compared to national elections is                     explained by the transfer of votes from large and governing parties to small and                     opposition parties. Nevertheless, anti-EU parties and green parties on average                     do better in European elections than in national elections. But these “European                     effects” are minor, and the position a party takes on Europe is largely                     irrelevant to its performance.

  abstract = {It is well-established that voters behave very differently in European Parliament (EP) elections compared to national elections. They are more likely to switch their allegiances to smaller opposition parties or even to abstain. The classic explanation is that these changing patterns of behavior are due to the fact that less is at stake in 'second-order' EP elections. While this second-order explanation aptly captures the primary characteristic of EP elections, it has often led to a conflation of three quite distinct motivations for changing behavior, namely sincere voting, strategic protest voting and arena-specific voting. By clearly distinguishing among different types of motivations driving second-order voting behavior, we are able to address the important question of when and why voters are more likely to rely on sincere, strategic and arena specific considerations in EP elections. We argue that the primary conditioning factors are located at two levels. At the individual-level, voters are differently motivated depending on which type of party they normally support. At the context-level, the level of politicization of the EU in the domestic debate shapes the degree of arena-specific voting. These propositions are tested in a multi-level analysis of voting behavior in 27 countries in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Our findings have important implications for understanding why voters change their behavior between different types of elections.},

The elections saw an unprecedented surge in support for Eurosceptic parties. This raises the question of whether the crisis, and the EU's response to it, can explain the rise of Eurosceptic parties. Our analysis of the 2014 European Election Study demonstrates that the degree to which individuals were adversely affected by the crisis and their discontent with the EU's handling of the crisis are major factors in explaining defection from mainstream pro-European to Eurosceptic parties in these elections. This suggests that far from being second-order national elections concerned only with domestic politics, European issues had a significant impact on vote choices.},

The theory is tested using a properly specified model for the 1956 national voting data and then for the 1948 Elmira data. In both cases no evidence of the existence of cross-pressure effects is found.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade there has been an explosion of developments in mixed e?ects models and their applications. This book concentrates on two major classes of mixed e?ects models, linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models, with the intention of o?ering an up-to-date account of theory and methods in the analysis of these models as well as their applications in various ?elds. The ?rst two chapters are devoted to linear mixed models. We classify l- ear mixed models as Gaussian (linear) mixed models and non-Gaussian linear mixed models. There have been extensive studies in estimation in Gaussian mixed models as well as tests and con?dence intervals. On the other hand, the literature on non-Gaussian linear mixed models is much less extensive, partially because of the di?culties in inference about these models. However, non-Gaussian linear mixed models are important because, in practice, one is never certain that normality holds. This book o?ers a systematic approach to inference about non-Gaussian linear mixed models. In particular, it has included recently developed methods, such as partially observed information, iterative weighted least squares, and jackknife in the context of mixed models. Other new methods introduced in this book include goodness-of-?t tests, p- diction intervals, and mixed model selection. These are, of course, in addition to traditional topics such as maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood in Gaussian mixed models.},

We test the model using election data from the new member states and find that voters do not cast protest votes against their incumbent national governments in second-order elec tions, that is, elections where voters believe little to be at stake. This finding contradicts one of the model's basic propositions and runs counter to the empirical reality in the old member states, with potentially significant implications for inter and intra-institutional politics in the EU.},

Drawing on the existing literature on differences between the sexes in political engagement and on pioneering voter turnout theories, this article questions the conventional assumption and hypothesises that women still participate at a lower rate in less important elections. It systematically tests this hypothesis by exploring the impact of gender on voter turnout in different electoral arenas. The empirical analyses of two cross-national datasets (Making Electoral Democracy Work and the European Election Study) demonstrate that although there is generally no gender gap in first-order elections, women tend to vote less than men in second-order contests. This reflects lower levels of interest in politics among women and their lower levels of knowledge about politics when it comes to second-order elections.},

  abstract = {Today we are politically polarized as never before. The presidential elections of 2000 and 2004 will be remembered as two of the most contentious political events in American history. Yet despite the recent election upheaval, The American Voter Revisited discovers that voter behavior has been remarkably consistent over the last half century. And if the authors are correct in their predictions, 2008 will show just how reliably the American voter weighs in, election after election. The American Voter Revisited re-creates the outstanding 1960 classic The American Voter---which was based on the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956---following the same format, theory, and mode of analysis as the original. In this new volume, the authors test the ideas and methods of the original against presidential election surveys from 2000 and 2004. Surprisingly, the contemporary American voter is found to behave politically much like voters of the 1950s. "Simply essential. For generations, serious students of American politics have kept The American Voter right on their desk. Now, everyone will keep The American Voter Revisited right next to it." ---Larry J. Sabato, Director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of A More Perfect Constitution "The American Voter Revisited is destined to be the definitive volume on American electoral behavior for decades. It is a timely book for 2008, with in-depth analyses of the 2000 and 2004 elections updating and extending the findings of the original The American Voter. It is also quite accessible, making it ideal for graduate students as well as advanced undergrads." ---Andrew E.

  abstract = {In the ongoing debate over the democratic credentials of the European Union, two competing viewpoints have emerged over time: one that characterizes the EU as conforming to the democratic expectations in the larger public discourse and the other that it does not conform to those expectations. When looked at over the time span of almost three decades, each viewpoint has made significant contributions to the ongoing debate as to the future course of the EU. In the process, each approach has evolved into what could be loosely be characterized as an independent school of thought. For this paper, the former school will be termed the Democratic Deficit School (DDS) while the latter will be called the Non-Conformist School (NCS). Employing a limited content analysis of the various arguments mustered for both positions, this paper examines the strengths, weakness, divergences and compatibilities between these respective schools of thought.Drawing on arguments from both the DDS and NCS approaches, the paper argues in favor of an emergent DDS paradigm to explain the current realities of the existing institutional architecture and the (often) competing priorities of member states and their respective supranational and intergovernmental visions. The undergirding thesis, here, is that the NCS school of thought, while offering compelling reasoning, especially in accounting for the early events in EU economic integration, fails to fully consider its unique, sui-generis nature as a hybrid entity in explaining later transitions as the EU has taken on greater roles in the political arena. The tangible result is that its technocratic, utilitarian aspects of the entity are mistaken for a loss of democratic representation and impulse within the EU itself.},

  abstract = {Voting behavior in elections to the European Parliament seems to follow a regular pattern, as many EP-election studies have found: Parties in government at the national level tend to lose vote shares in EP-elections as compared to the last domestic electoral contest; small and ideologically more extreme parties tend to gain vote shares. These losses and gains seem to be more pronounced when the European election is held in the middle of the domestic legislative term (mid-term effect). In the many accounts that try to explain these regular deviations from domestic voting, one causal factor plays a central role: the popularity loss of parties in office at the national level. Since reliable and comparable popularity data for the EU-member states seems to be missing, the literature has attempted to measure popularity loss with two kinds of proxies: changes in economic performance (e.g. changes in the unemployment rate) and the timing of the EP-election within the domestic term. This paper proposes to use the bi-annually collected national vote intention question of the Eurobarometer surveys as a measurement for party popularity. The paper has three central findings: 1) changes in national vote intention are a strong and stable predictor for the actual vote share shifts between national and European elections, 2) neither the economic nor the election timing variables contribute substantially to the explanation of the vote share shifts; 3) changes in the impact of the national vote intention variable on European election outcomes over the six EPelections held so far suggest that the European electorates have taken European issues more and more into consideration when participating in European elections (Europeanization of EPelections). However, the data also suggests that voters have used these elections increasingly to voice their dissatisfaction with the European integration process (Anti-Europeanization of EPelections).},

Turnout is affected partly by the same factors that affect turnout in normal national elections and partly by factors related to the EU. The results show that most of the cross-country variation in turnout can be explained by the same variables as in national elections. Compulsory voting, weekend voting and having other elections simultaneously with EP elections increase turnout. Also some EU specific factors affect turnout, but their effect is smaller. Voters in countries benefiting from the EU subsidies vote more actively than voters in the countries that pay these subsidies. Furthermore, turnout is higher in countries with strong support for the EU membership. Holding elections during weekends and having multiple constituencies in all countries could increase the turnout by approximately 10 percentage points.},

  abstract = {The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.},

Disentangling and isolating the unique effects of peer behavior, selection processes, and congruent interests is a challenge for all studies of interpersonal influence. This study proposes and utilizes a carefully designed placebo-controlled experimental protocol to overcome this identification problem. During a face-to-face canvassing experiment targeting households with two registered voters, residents who answered the door were exposed to either a Get Out the Vote message (treatment) or a recycling pitch (placebo). The turnout of the person in the household not answering the door allows for contagion to be measured. Both experiments find that 60\% of the propensity to vote is passed onto the other member of the household. This finding suggests a mechanism by which civic participation norms are adopted and couples grow more similar over time.},

  abstract = {Since direct elections to the European Parliament began in 1979, variations in voting behavior in European Parliament (EP) elections from national elections raise interesting questions about political behavior. Previous studies into European elections conclude that turnout is lower because EP elections are second order contests, meaning that they are seen as extensions of national politics and of low importance. However, as the EU has grown, some studies have found that European considerations do influence electoral outcomes in EP elections. In this study, I add to this growing literature on how Europe matter and I argue that EP elections are more complicated than second order contests. Through a cross-national study of national and European elections, I find that European turnout drops when an EP election follows a national election but rises when an EP election precedes a national election. I also find that the European cycle matters as voters compare EP elections to prior EP elections as the timelines interact with one another. Overall, I conclude that time matters in political behavior and that the interactions between national timelines and European timelines impacts electoral outcomes by decreasing turnout during frequent elections or periods where there are a high number of elections. I conclude that the multi-level democracy of the European Union challenges voters and complicates simple acts such as voting, discouraging participation.},

Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird diese aktuelle Diskussion um eine weitere Erklärungsgröße, die Akzeptanz der demokratischen Wahlnorm, erweitert. Unter Verwendung der Daten einer Wiederholungsbefragung in den Jahren 1992 und 1993 finden sich in den im Quer- und im Längsschnitt durchgeführten bivariaten Analysen ausgeprägte Beziehungen zwischen Akzeptanz der Wahlnorm und individueller Wahlbeteiligung. Die Schätzung zweier Kausalmodelle macht deutlich, daß die Wahlnorm die stärkste Determinante der Wahlbeteiligung bzw. der Veränderung der Wahlbeteiligung ist. Research attempting to account for the decline of electoral turnout in Germany has focused predominantly on social and attitudinal determinants, such as levels of interest in politics, satisfaction with democracy, and partisan attachments. This article extends this current discussion by introducing another key factor, the acceptance of the democratic norm to participate in elections. Using panel data from a 1992-93 survey, we find strong bivariate associations between this norm and turnout, both in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal perspective. The estimation of two causal models demonstrates that the precept to go voting is the single most important determinant of total turnout and of changes in individual turnout.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The composition of the directly elected European Parliament does not precisely reflect the “real” balance of political forces in the European Community. As long as the national political systems decide most of what there is to be decided politically, and everything really important, European elections are additional national second-order elections. They are determined more by the domestic political cleavages than by alternatives originating in the EC, but in a different way than if nine first-order national elections took place simultaneously. This is the case because European elections occur at different stages of the national political systems' respective “electoral cycles”. Such a relationship between a second-order arena and the chief arena of a political system is not at all unusual. What is new here, is that one second-order political arena is related to nine different first-order arenas. A first analysis of European election results satisfactorily justifies the assumption that European Parliament direct elections should be treated as nine simultaneous national second-order elections.},

This model has been successfully applied to European and subnational elections taking place in Western Europe but it fares far less well in explaining electoral outcomes in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). I refine the model by differentiating between six party types (large and small government and opposition parties and new and no-seat parties) and by introducing the state of the economy (economic growth, inflation and unemployment) as explanatory variable instead of time elapsed between first- and second-order elections. An analysis on 488 regional elections taking place in 6 CEE countries shows that second-order effects relate to the state of the economy that has a different impact depending on party type. These results strongly suggest that regional elections in CEE are second-order but in order to be able to trace SOE effects the SOE model needs to be refined.},

Die Überraschung beruhte also darauf, daß man auf die Wirkmächtigkeit in jüngerer Zeit geschaffener Tatsachen gesetzt, dagegen die Dauerhaftigkeit historisch älterer Kräfte wie etwa ethnischer und kultureller Identitäten und Konflikte unterschätzt hatte.},

Using data from the 2014 European Elections Study, an EU-wide post-election survey, we analyse whether and how the presence of the lead candidates influenced the individual probability to participate in these elections. Our findings show that the recognition of the candidates increased the propensity to turn out, even when controlling for a host of other individual-level factors explaining turnout and the context factors known to facilitate participation. Furthermore, the campaign efforts of the lead candidates are associated with higher turnout levels and are reinforced by candidate recognition.},

Economic crisis, bailout packages, and austerity measures were central on the agenda in many Southern countries while open borders and intra-EU migration gained high salience elsewhere in the Union. A strong decline of political trust in European and national institutions was alarming. At the same time, the nomination and campaigning of “ Spitzenkandidaten ”, lead candidates of EP political groups for European Commission (EC) presidency, was meant to establish a new linkage between European Parliament elections and the (s)election of the president of the Commission. All of this might have changed the very nature of EP elections as second-order national elections. In this paper, we try to shed light on this by analysing aggregate election results, both at the country-level and at the party-level and compare them with the results of the preceding first-order national election in each EU member country. Our results suggest that the ongoing politicisation of EU politics had little impact on the second-order nature of European Parliament elections.},

Die besondere Relevanz dieses Themas für die Neuen Bundesländer liegt auf der Hand. Hier wurde ein neues politisches System installiert, mit für den einzelnen oft gravierenden Konsequenzen hinsichtlich seiner Lebensumstände. Die Stabilität dieses Systems dürfte zumindest auf die Dauer nicht unwesentlich davon abhängen, in welchem Maße es Unterstützung durch die Bevölkerung erfährt. Nach allen derzeit vorliegenden Umfragedaten ist in den Neuen Bundesländern allerdings eher eine Tendenz zur Unzufriedenheit mit dem neuen System und eine entsprechende Protesthaltung feststellbar. Mögliche Gründe für einen Protest gibt es aus individueller Sicht genug. Ist es nicht ein Grund zu protestieren, wenn statt der erhofften „blühenden Landschaften“ erst einmal wirtschaftliche Problemgebiete mit entsprechenden Folgeerscheinungen wie Arbeitslosigkeit, sozialem Abstieg etc. entstehen oder wenn Politiker ganz offensichtlich ihre Versprechen nicht halten? Wenn ja, dann lautet eine wichtige Frage: Wogegen richtet sich der Protest? Gegen einzelne Parteien, deren Politiker in den Augen des Wählers schuld an den Mißständen sind, oder gegen alle Parteien überhaupt? Letzteres würde vermutlich langfristig zur Destabilisierung des politischen Systems beitragen.},

This paper addresses the puzzle of declining turnout in European Parliament elections. After reviewing the influential “second order elections” explanation emphasizing domestic influences on turnout, especially Mark Franklin’s recent study stressing the importance of electoral salience factors, we develop a revised model to incorporate EU as well as domestic variables. Our model indicates that EU influences, at least on the aggregate level, may have more influence on EP elections than previously reported. Tests of our model for the first five EP elections, 1979 through 1999, find that it provides an alternative explanation of turnout similar in power to Franklin’s model. Because of changes in membership of the EU, our alternative model may be preferable for explaining future turnout variation in EU elections.},

  abstract = {The project of European integration now spans Europe, but in becoming bigger and broader the European Union has brought on itself significant criticism. As the EU becomes deeper, wider, and more ambitious, so opposition and scepticism become more prominent for citizens and more problematic for elites. Concerns about a 'democratic deficit' and the distance between European elites and publics have come to be a common feature of European politics. As a consequence Euroscepticism has become a part of the terrain of conflict between political parties across Europe. Opposing Europe? provides the first comprehensive review of party-based Euroscepticism across the breadth of contemporary Europe and the first in-depth comparative academic study of Euroscepticism. This, the second of two volumes, is made up of comparative chapters which address different aspects of Euroscepticism. The volume looks across Europe and includes EU member states and candidate and non-member states in order to draw out comparative lessons that relate to the nature of political parties, party systems, and the domestic politics of European integration. Opposing Europe? is a groundbreaking, 'state of the art' book that provides a definitive review of a key issue in European politics. It is also one of the few attempts to integrate the fields of EU studies with both West European and East European studies in order to draw lessons about the way in which the EU interacts with domestic politics in both member and non-member states. Examining the way that parties position themselves and compete on the European issue provides powerful lessons for the trajectory of the European integration project more generally, and on the prospects for the emergence of a European political system and polity.},

  abstract = {Abstract. With the recent acceleration of the integration process of the European Union there has been a rise in political parties expressing either scepticism or outright criticism of the nature of the integration process. Using a four–fold differentiation between single issue, protest, established parties and factions within parties, the first part of the article presents an overview of Euroscepticism within EU member states and Norway. This reveals the diversity of sources of Euroscepticism both in ideology and in the types of parties that are Eurosceptical but with a preponderance of protest parties taking Eurosceptical positions. The second part of the article is an attempt to map Euroscepticism in West European party systems through a consideration of ideology and party position in the party system. The conclusions are that Euroscepticism is mainly limited to parties on the periphery of their party system and is often there used as an issue that differentiates those parties from the more established parties which are only likely to express Euroscepticism through factions. Party based Euroscepticism is therefore both largely dependent on domestic contextual factors and a useful issue to map emergent domestic political constellations.},

  abstract = {Academic research lends significant support to the expectation that there is a strong link between the economy and election outcomes. Voters hold incumbents responsible for the national economy: public support for governing parties drops when the economy performs poorly and increases when the economy grows. However, not all elections are determined by the economy. Economic voting is found often, but not always and not everywhere, and it remains unclear why that is. The recent financial and economic crisis has further accentuated the concerns as to the instability of economic voting. The majority of Western countries experienced steep recession, which should lead to major political consequences. Indeed, a number of governing parties witnessed landslide electoral defeat, but on several other occasions incumbents managed to maintain their position despite the unprecedented economic turmoil. The instability in economic voting was the main motivation for writing this dissertation. If the link between economic conditions and elections does not exist, then voters’ ability to assign responsibility for economic outcomes is limited, and this leaves leaders free to pursue whatever policies they please irrespective of their public consequences. However, when the mechanism of democratic accountability is in good health, then citizens maintain their ability to participate in the process of decision-making and help determine national policy. The dissertation addressed economic voting from three different aspects. Firstly, it tested the overall strength of the link between the economy and political support. The analysis, which relied on an extensive dataset of surveys across nations and over time, demonstrated, that economic considerations have a strong effect on incumbent support. Citizens regularly observe national economic outcomes and shape their electoral decisions accordingly. Secondly, the work examined the performance of economic voting in Europe in the wake of the financial and economic crisis. The findings show that the statistical relationship between the economy and voting remained remarkably constant, even after the most dramatic economic recession in our lifetime, suggesting that the economic voting mechanism is largely immune to external shocks. Finally, the dissertation revealed a new dimension of economic voting by shifting the focus onto national economic policies. Citizens paid more attention to national fiscal policies after the crisis than they did before, and on many occasions held incumbents responsible for painful austerity programs. In fact, economic policies have emerged as one of the key predictors of individual vote choice next to more conventional determinants, revealing the new and multidimensional face of economic voting.},

Almond und Verba (1965) sprechen in diesem Zusammenhang von einer notwendigen Kongruenz von politischer Kultur und politischer Struktur als Faktor der Stabilität des politischen Systems, denn „kein demokratisches System kann ohne die Akzeptanz und Unterstützung durch die Bevölkerung existieren“ (Gluchowski/Zelle 1992: 251).},

Previous research has reported an association between personality traits and turnout, but their results have been inconsistent. Nevertheless, there is a solid evidence of gender differences in personality traits and past studies have not taken into consideration the option that personality–turnout relationship might be gender-differentiated. The current study empirically finds that conscientiousness and emotional stability can significantly increase female turnout, but have no effect on male turnout. Furthermore, openness to experience exerts opposite effects on male and female turnout. As openness to experience increases, men become more likely to vote, whereas women become less likely to cast their ballots. However, extraversion and agreeableness are not associated with turnout, regardless of gender. To sum up, this study provides robust evidence that the effects of personality traits on turnout vary by gender and suggests that any future study of the topic must include interaction between gender and personality in order to estimate the effect of personality on turnout in a more accurate manner.},

Fünf Jahre nach der deutschen Vereinigung dominieren Begriffe wie Politik- und Parteienverdrossenheit die Diskussion. Vereinigungsprobleme und Schwierigkeiten beim ‚Institutionentransfer‘ von West nach Ost, Anfang der neunziger Jahre noch intensiv diskutiert (Eichener/Kleinfeld/ Pollack u.a. 1992; Lehmbruch 1994), sind als Themen weitgehend verschwunden. Ähnliches gilt für die Ende der achtziger Jahre aufgeworfene Frage nach der Erosion des intermediären Systems im Zuge des sozialen Wandels (Alemann 1985; Streeck 1987; Weßels 1991b). Alle drei Aspekte -Vereinigungsprobleme, die Leistungsfähigkeit und das Erscheinungsbild der Akteure der Interessenvermittlung sowie der soziale Wandel — bestimmen jedoch in unterschiedlicher Weise das Verhältnis der Bürger zu den Institutionen der Interessenvermittlung.},

Sie reichen von einer weiteren Abnahme des schon früher geringen nationalen Selbstwertgefühls und einer nationalen Identitätskrise (Herdegen/Schultz 1993) bis hin zu einer großen Verbreitung aggressiven Nationalismus (Weissbrod 1994). Zur Frage der inneren Einheit von West- und Ostdeutschen stehen sich die Annahmen einer gemeinsamen Identität (Herdegen/Schultz 1993; Gebhardt/Kamphausen 1994; Veen 1994) und mentaler Unvereinbarkeit gegenüber (Maaz 1991; Woderich 1992; Schorlemmer 1993).},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates rational choice models of political participation both at the theoretical and empirical levels. The theoretical discussion is con cerned with evaluating attempts which have been made to circumvent the paradox of participation-the proposition introduced by Mancur Olson that rational actors will not get involved in collective action in order to achieve common goals. The analysis suggests that the paradox is more of an intrac table problem for rational choice theory than is commonly recognized. The empirical section of the paper uses data from the first national survey of Conservative party members in Britain to model the determinants of political activism. It tests rational actor models against an alternative "general incen tives" theory of participation which includes variables that are not consis tent with rational choice theory. The conclusion is that while a rational choice model gives great insights into political participation, it provides an in complete account of participation, and by implication this may be true of such models in other areas of political science.},

  abstract = {If Richard Simeon's “Studying Public Policy” sought to inspire a theory of policy making, however tentative or crude, its conceptual cornerstone was no doubt the “funnel of causality.” Yet references to the funnel of causality have all but disappeared from the policy literature. This article traces the evolution of the thinking that underlies the funnel of causality with the aim of demonstrating its lasting relevance to policy studies. Being a method for understanding how inputs from various levels of abstraction impact policy outcomes, the interaction and feedback effects implicit in the funnel metaphor have been maintained in subsequent neo-institutionalist work that takes seriously the institutional and sociological environment in which policy making takes place, particularly that which is interested in the origins and operation of policy subsystems, policy communities or networks, and policy regimes.},

The question of who votes matters greatly to everyone involved in politics and to all those concerned about the current and future state of American democracy. Based on data from the 1972 and 1974 Census Bureau surveys, Wolfinger and Rosenstone are able to identify for the first time those social and economic groups that are most likely to vote and to explain sensibly and convincingly those factors that influence voter turnout.},
